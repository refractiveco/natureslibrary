# Reading Nature's Library

Reading Nature's Library is a citizen science project where anyone can help Manchester Museum catalogue their fossil collection. Images of the fossils are viewed by members of the public who input the label data from the images to build a database of the collection.

Research work has been conducted using this application to test whether login pages help or hinder citizen science contribution rates.
